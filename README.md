The intro was released at Assembly 2015 and obtained 5th place.

Initially built upon dx9 example in hitchhikr's 1kpack release v0.9c. Was later ported to Crinkler 2.0 for better compression.

Requires the files: ```d3d9.lib```, ```d3dx9.lib```, ```kernel32.lib```, ```user32.lib```, ```winmm.lib```. Also Crinkler 2.0 required.

See file ```compile.py``` for more info on compilation.
